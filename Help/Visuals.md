# VISUALS TAB
This tab containts the **livery sharing** feature along with some other helpful features to aid you with livery creation. You can only use these features while in the garage.

**`ENABLE SYMMETRY FOR ALL LAYERS`** allows you to mirror all layers to the other side of the car at once.

**`DISABLE SYMMETRY FOR ALL LAYERS`** disables mirroring of all the layers.

**`REPLACE MATERIAL`** changes the material for all the layers. No reverse button so use with caution.
  
**`ZOOM`** allows to get the camera closer to the car (helps with creating small details on your liveries).
  
**`SHIFT`** moves the camera along the Y or Z axes. This might come in handy when drawing something on the front/rear arches of your car.
  
**`SAVE CURRENT DESIGN`** saves your current design (livery, body color as well as a bodykit option). Files are saved to ***CarX Drift Racing Online\BepInEx\plugins\KN_Base\visuals***.

**`LOAD DESIGN`** loads the designs from the folder. If you downloaded a livery and want to put it on your car then you need to put the file inside the location mentioned earlier and choose the file from the list. *DON'T OPEN THE EDITOR WHEN APPLYING THE LIVERIES*.

**`APPLY DESIGN TO`** applies the full design (livery, body color and the bodykit) to the car it was made for (unless the file has been renamed, the car is stated in the file name). 

**`ADD LIVERY TO`** adds only the livery from the chosen design. Liveries get added to a new slot so even if you hit the limit on slots for the liveries, the mod will just create a slot over the limit.

**`RESTORE DESIGN`** reverts the design back to how you car looked before applying the new design.
