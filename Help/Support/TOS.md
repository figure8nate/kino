## Donation process
Assuming you want to get a full advantage of your benefits for supporting the mod, read through the following guide which will explain everything regarding the process that follows after you make your donation on Patreon and more.  
1. **Receiving the patreon supporter role.**  
Once you have made the donation, you should receive the aforementioned role in our discord. For that you need to make sure you have linked your Discord in your Patreon account settings. How long it will take for you to receive the role is entirely up to Patreon and there’s nothing we can do on our side to speed up the process.  
2. **Permanent supporter role and access to Extras module.**  
As mentioned in the terms of service, discord exclusive rewards are permanent and don’t require you to stay subscribed to our Patreon. After you receive the role you should get a DM on discord from our bot, which will ask you to provide the link to your steam account. This is mandatory for the validation process needed for you to get access to the Extras module so please keep your DMs open.  

   2.1. To get the link: Go to your Steam profile page, right click anywhere (for an example on the profile background) and click **`Copy Page URL`**.  
   ![steam context](../../Images/steam_context.png)

   2.2 Respond to the bot with the link following the command !steam like in an example bellow:
   > !steam https://steamcommunity.com/id/examplelink

   2.3 If the link you have provided is correct, the bot will respond to you confirming that it’s a working link and you will have to await for validation. Once you are validated you will also get a notification from the bot.  

   2.4 Validation time: This part relies on how quickly Patreon bot is gonna give you the patreon supporter role (which might take up to a few hours from personal experience). After you get a DM from our bot and provide a valid steam link it might take up to 24 hours depending on our availability. While normally it would take a lot less, please understand that the process of validation is not automatic.  
   
   2.5 If you don’t get a DM from our bot after receiving the patreon supporter role - please open a ticket on our server. We will try to resolve it as quickly as possible.
# FAQ
- Will I get Extras if I donate?
  > Up to you. Extras are not a part of Patreon pledge reward since the distribution of the reward heavily relies on your cooperation, however every Patreon supporter is eligible to gain access to the Extras module as a part of discord exclusive reward.
- Can I donate for a friend?
  > If you have a friend who is unable to donate through the means of Patreon or for some other reason - you can open a ticket in our discord and we might try to come up with a solution.
- Do I have to stay subscribed to maintain my access to Extras?
  > As mentioned earlier, you don’t have to stay subscribed to maintain the access to the module. The supporter role as well and the access to the Extras are permanent.
- I got the patreon supporter role but I haven’t received a DM from the bot!
  > If for some reason our bot is down and failed to send you a message or you had your DMs closed, please open a ticket in our Discord.
