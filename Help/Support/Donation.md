# Donation help

If you are visiting this page you are probably wondering what perks you get for donating or how to claim your rewards for the donation. Either way this page should answer all of your questions.

### **How do I donate?**
If you wish to support KINO mod developers, you might donate via PayPal by using the link to a [Google form](https://forms.gle/Zq1ThXMmHnuUk5jg8). The minimal donation to get the Extras is 1 USD, the currency doesn't matter as long as it accounts for the same amount. The link to the PayPal is on the second page of the form, the form itself doesn't account for a donation, it purely exists to gather contect info. Don't forget to submit the form after filling it out.

### **What do I get for donating?**
To learn about the features you get for supporting the mod development, visit the [Extras](../Extras.md) page. You also get get the **Supporter** role on our discord assuming you are a member on our server and entered the correct name in the google form.

### **How long does it take for me to get my stuff?**
 The process of verfiying your donation is not automatic. You don't need to  download any extra files, however you do need to get validated. Under normal conditions it might take up to 12 hours for your validation due to our personal life and the general need for sleep.

### **I donated but didn't get the Extras!**
If it's been over 24 hours since you donated and you still didn't get the Extras, then it's 99,9% your own fault. There are a few possible reasons for that:  
* **You didn't submit the form.**
  You might have filled it out, however unless you got to the last page thanking you for submitting it, it means you didn't actually send it.
* **You entered the invalid Steam link, or left your username/login/whatever else.**  
Idealy we need your steamID64 for the validation, however if you don't know how to get it, links work as well. There is also an explanation on how to get the link in the google form. Please read it. It's not optional and is absolutely mandatory for you to get the Extras. Example of how the link to your account should look:
    > https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067044838  
    > https://steamcommunity.com/id/examplelink
 
* **You didn't actually donate, donated insufficient ammount, or entered invalid PayPal name.**  
We need your PayPal name to verify your donation. Unless we can find your donation in the PayPal activity feed, there's no way for us to confirm that you actually made the donation. Normally your PayPal name consist of your **name** and **surname** unless you have a custom profile name. You might also leave the **e-mail** you use for your PayPal account just in case. We are not asking for your paypal.me name, as it doesn't show up on the activity feed. We don't care whether you used your friends/siblings/parents PayPal account, all we care is whether we can find your donation or not.

### **Okay, I got the Supporter role, what now?**
If you got the role it means you donation has been processed and you now have the Extras. The only thing you need to do is start the game. If it doesn't appear right away, try restarting the game in a couple minutes.

### **And most importantly...**  
We appreciate every single donation and are greatful to all the people who supported us and allow us to invest our time in developing the mod. However if you want to claim the Extra stuff it is entirely your responsibility to provide valid information needed for validation. It's in your best interest to make it easier for us. Thank you for your understanding.
